The binomial distribution is a discrete probability distribution used to
model bounded counts. Specifically, a binomial random variable $x$ represents
% the $ delimiter marks the start and end of a mathematical expression
the number of successes in $n$ independent Bernoulli trials, where $p$ is
the probability of success, and $1-p$ the probability of failure.

% a blank line means a new paragraph

The probability mass function of the binomial distribution is:

\begin{equation}
	f(x | n,p) = {n \choose x} p^x (1-p)^{n-x} % note the need for braces around the n-x
\end{equation}

\noindent where $x = 0,1,2,\ldots,n$ and $p \in [0,1]$.

Applications of the binomial distribution include:

\begin{itemize} % this is an unordered list

	\item Estimation of probabilities of outcomes in any set of success or failure trials

	\item Estimation of probabilities of outcomes in games of chance

	\item Sampling of attribute

\end{itemize}

\section{Binomial sampling}

Here is a random sample from a binomial distribution with parameters $p=0.4$ and $n=20$:
